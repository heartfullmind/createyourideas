We would like to introduce a playful component for this, which, like a computer game, makes it possible to restart again. We also try to create a pool of money with sponsors, investors and patrons, with whom we then want to promote these ideas in the community. So we want to create a platform that everyone can open a small business and so in a simpler way than in today's market a small business we start talking about an idea to be his own boss. We think that we can let the growth of the market grow in a playful way."
